# electoral-weights
States' areas do not correlate with their electoral weights!
EVERY four years, without fail, the same thing happens: someone gawks at the map and says "Look at all this [color A]; but you're telling me [color B] won??"

The way in which we use the map to demonstrate electoral voting is incredibly misleading. SEVERAL New Jerseys could fit inside Wyoming; and yet NJ has more than 4x the electoral weight that Wyoming has.

In this project, I propose a *better* way to track election coverage. A little proportionality goes a long way.
